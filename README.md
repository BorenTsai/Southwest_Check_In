# Southwest_Check_In

A simple python3 program made to ensure that you get the best boarding position possible
for all flights with Southwest Airlines

Before use, enter your flight information (confirmation #, first and last name, and flight time)
in the corresponding variable declarations. To use, in the time leading up to your flight, simply 
execute the command "python3 checkin.py" for MacOS/Linux users ("python checkin.py" for Windows) 
in your terminal and rest easy knowing that your checkin will be taken care of for you. Once 
properly executed, the program will terminate by itself and notify you that your check-in has been
successful.

IMPORTANT: your device must be turned on and running the python file for the program to function as intended.
